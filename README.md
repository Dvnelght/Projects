# Projects

This github page contains demos of the Spring framework.
All of the files containing "practice" in their name were written entirely from scratch by me.

Currently, it contains:

    1) spring-demo-xml, spring demo apps configured using xml files.
    2) spring-demo-annotations, spring demo apps configured using annotations or java code
